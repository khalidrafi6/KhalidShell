Linux has some special **SysRq Key** commands that can help manage system issues. The kernel always responds to these commands, no matter what state the computer is in - even if it's completely frozen. However, if the kernel itself is completely locked up, that's a different story. The **SysRq** feature is extremely useful when system errors occur. For example, if your computer freezes and stops responding to any input, you can use **SysRq** to shut down or reboot the computer.

If your kernel was compiled with **SysRq** support, you can enable/disable its functions via `/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq`. The `/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq` file may contain the following values:

0 - Completely disables **SysRq**

1 - Enables all **SysRq** functions

> 1 - __bitmask__ of allowed **SysRq** functions

You can set values in this file using the following command:
```shell
echo "number" > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
