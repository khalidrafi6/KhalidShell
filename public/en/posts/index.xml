      <description>&lt;p&gt;Firefox has some nice extensions we regularly use on desktop. But sadly, many extensions are not available on Android. So, we can&amp;rsquo;t enjoy the same Firefox on Android which we use on our computers. Howeever, there is a workaround to install desktop extensions which are unavailable on Android. Let me show how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &amp;ldquo;About Firefox&amp;rdquo; in your Firefox app on Android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap the Firefox logo 7 times. This will enable the Debug Menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the page for your extension in addons.mozilla.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll notice a new option named &amp;ldquo;Download file&amp;rdquo; under the install option which is disabled. Download it. It will download a file with .xpi format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, go to settings again. You will see a new option named &amp;ldquo;Install extensions from file&amp;rdquo; in your settings. Install the .xpi file with that option. Voila! Your desktop extension is now installed in your phone!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that there may be compatibility issues. Some extensions may not work in your phone. It&amp;rsquo;s normal because those extensions were only made for desktop use. Their developers didn&amp;rsquo;t optimize them for Android. In such case, request the corresponding developer to make the extension officially available for Android.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
