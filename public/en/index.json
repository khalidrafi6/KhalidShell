[{"content":"Firefox has some nice extensions we regularly use on desktop. But sadly, many extensions are not available on Android. So, we can\u0026rsquo;t enjoy the same Firefox on Android which we use on our computers. Howeever, there is a workaround to install desktop extensions which are unavailable on Android. Let me show how:\nGo to \u0026ldquo;About Firefox\u0026rdquo; in your Firefox app on Android. Tap the Firefox logo 7 times. This will enable the Debug Menu. Visit the page for your extension in addons.mozilla.org You\u0026rsquo;ll notice a new option named \u0026ldquo;Download file\u0026rdquo; under the install option which is disabled. Download it. It will download a file with .xpi format. Now, go to settings again. You will see a new option named \u0026ldquo;Install extensions from file\u0026rdquo; in your settings. Install the .xpi file with that option. Voila! Your desktop extension is now installed in your phone! Please note that there may be compatibility issues. Some extensions may not work in your phone. It\u0026rsquo;s normal because those extensions were only made for desktop use. Their developers didn\u0026rsquo;t optimize them for Android. In such case, request the corresponding developer to make the extension officially available for Android.\n","tags":null,"title":"How to install desktop extensions in Firefox for Android","url":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/firefox-android-desktop-extensions/"}]
